title: Developer Day - Customer-Driven Engineering at Scale
---

Within the Developer Division (DevDiv), everyone from our product teams talk to customers, every day. Yet, one time each year, DevDiv hosts a large-scale event that brings our customers and product teams together. While this event takes place over a single day each year, it truly exemplifies what it’s like to work in DevDiv every single day.

We call this event Developer Day and it brings 200 of our employees together with over 100 customers, during the week of Build, to have conversations about the future of our products and look for new opportunities to serve our customers.

We also invite leaders from other divisions within Microsoft to give them a chance to, not only connect with our developer community, but to learn more about our customer-driven culture.

“We took a lot of leaders, from other divisions, to come observe and learn; because we feel this process can be further scaled out to more Microsoft teams,” explains Julia Liuson, CVP of Visual Studio.

# Conducting "Speed Interviews"
To create so many customer connections we organize the event using a “speed interviewing” format. Essentially, each customer is assigned a table and a PM and Engineer, from our team, pair up to conduct interviews.
 
Each interview is set to 20 minutes and, after the time is up, our employees move on to the next customer table. This results in each PM and Engineer pair getting a chance to speak to six customers.

While conducting six interviews can be demanding, it gives our product teams an opportunity to generate many customer touch points. Developer Day will typically generate well over 600 interviews for our product teams. Many of our employees stay in contact with the customers they meet, well after the event.

# Finding the Right Customers
In a single event our product teams are given an opportunity to connect with an incredibly diverse sample of customers.

Almost all the customers that attend Developer Day are developers who have already registered for Build. Typically, anywhere between 700-800 Build attendees will request to be invited to our exclusive Developer Day event.

We work with our product teams to define their topics and create a developer profile for the type of customers they want to speak to.

Using Build registration data, we select customers that best match our developer profiles and extend an invitation to the customer.

This selection process allows us to create a sample of customers that represent nearly 30 countries and over 90 companies;comprising of both large and small development teams. Developer Day is full of customers that build applications for web, mobile, desktop, IoT, mixed reality, cloud services, and much more.

Once the customers accept their invitations, we generate hundreds of schedules, coordinating the product teams with their customers for each 20-minute time slot.

# Meeting Teams Where They Are
It’s not enough to just recruit customers, you also need to help the product teams plan for their customer interviews.
 
Every PM in DevDiv receives training and tools to employ our [Customer-Driven Engineering](/CustomerDrivenEngineering/ "Customer-Driven Engineering") approach. Armed with their own hypotheses and discussion guides, they’re able to go into their interviews with a plan for what they’re trying to learn.  

We promote the customer-driven approach at all stages of development so, no matter where teams are in their product’s lifecycle, they have what they need to be successful at Developer Day (and well beyond Developer Day too!).

We also leverage lightweight tools that are already in place. Each team gets its own OneNote notebook going into Developer Day. It has their individual schedules, a customer profile for each customer they will speak too, and a place for them to keep their hypotheses, discussion guides, and notes.

Additionally, DevDiv uses a “Customer Development Notes” e-mail alias, where each interview is summarized and e-mailed to the entire division. This has created a rich and searchable dataset of all our customer conversations without having to manage and deploy a new tool.

Our product teams have been using all of these tools and templates in their everyday work, so when it comes time to use them for Developer Day, they’re ready and prepared.

# Mixed Methods
While talking to customers is one of the easiest and fastest ways to collect direct feedback, Developer Day also gives our product teams opportunities to explore other research methods.

During the event, our customers will experience usability studies, activity walls, concept value tests, and even eye tracking studies.

Product teams are encouraged to employ multiple methods when learning from customers, so they can increase the confidence in their findings.

# Data that's Representative <i>and</i> Relatable
While Developer Day helps teams gain valuable product insights, the event has become so much more than just collecting customer data. It’s an opportunity for our employees to truly connect with the customers they serve.

Also, we aren’t the only ones that benefit from Developer Day. Our customers often leave feeling energized and hopeful about the future of Microsoft and our products.

Ginny Caughey, a customer and President of Carolina Software, Inc. loves Developer Day, “[It’s] a great opportunity to tell Microsoft exactly what I need; and I love it that Microsoft is becoming more transparent. So, I feel like you’re sharing your world with me.”
