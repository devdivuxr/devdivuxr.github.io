## Comment Policy

### Things that will cause your comments to be flagged

* Use of any of the curse words and/or slurs we have on our blacklist will automatically flag a comment so it wonâ€™t appear on our site. Sometimes these words are used as part of a good discussion, these comments will be approved by a moderator when appropriate.

* Using a Disqus account without a verified email address will automatically flag a comment.

* Comments can also be flagged for review by our readership (please do not abuse this option for other users you simply disagree with, it makes our moderation jobs a lot harder).

### Things that will get your comment deleted

* Personal attacks against another commenter or the writer of the post.

* Offensive or inappropriate language.

* Hate speech or anything else that the moderators deem as disruptive to the community dialog.
