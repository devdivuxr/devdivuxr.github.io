This site represents a collection of notes that have been collected by the Developer Division Team at Microsoft. 

Largely, you'll find the following types of resources:

* **Publication Notes:** These posts will consolidate our key findings and identify inter-dependent relationships from a publication (e.g. book, article, video, etc.). These should not be seen as "reviews" because, if we've posted notes about the publication in the first place, then we've agreed that it's worthy of your attention.

* **Process Notes:** In DevDiv, we subcribe to a Lean, Customer-Driven process in developing our software. Process notes will help define a single process or set of processes that we've found useful in achieving our goals toward a customer-obsessed culture.

### Comment Policy

#### Things that will cause your comments to be flagged

* Use of any of the curse words and/or slurs we have on our blacklist will automatically flag a comment so it wonâ€™t appear on our site. Sometimes these words are used as part of a good discussion, these comments will be approved by a moderator when appropriate.

* Using a Disqus account without a verified email address will automatically flag a comment.

* Comments can also be flagged for review by our readership (please do not abuse this option for other users you simply disagree with, it makes our moderation jobs a lot harder).

#### Things that will get your comment deleted

* Personal attacks against another commenter or the writer of the post.

* Offensive or inappropriate language.

* Hate speech or anything else that the moderators deem as disruptive to the community dialog.
